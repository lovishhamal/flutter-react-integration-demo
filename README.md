## Flutter integration with react using webview

In order to integrate flutter with react we have used a package called webview_flutter.

The first screen in the app represents a url loader which loads a website in the app. Here, the webview package provides a widget which takes initialUrl as a parameter and expects a valid url. To enable javascript in the website it expects javascript parameter to be unrestricted.
